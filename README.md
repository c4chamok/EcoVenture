## Key Features
1. **Navbar**: This includes links like Home, Update Profile, and My Profile pages, with options for Login/Logout and a user profile photo that shows the username on hover.
2. **Dynamic Adventure Cards**: Homepage has a slider for showing eco-adventures and a section to display dynamic cards with JSON data.
3. **Authentication**: Login and registration system with Google authentication, email/password validation, and a forgot password feature.
4. **Private Routes**: Access to Adventure Details and My Profile or Update Profile pages is restricted to logged-in users to secure individual interactions.
5. **Adventure Details**: A detailed page for each adventure includes a "Talk with Expert" button that opens Google Meet or displays consultation hours based on the time.

### React Concepts:
- **React Components**: Utilized components like Navbar, Footer, Adventure Cards, and Adventure Details for modular and reusable UI.
- **React Context API**: Used to manage user authentication and profile data without prop drilling across the application.
- **React Hooks**: React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useLocation`, and `useNavigate` for efficient state and navigation management.

### Packages Used:
- **React Router**: For implementing multi-page navigation and route protection.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **DaisyUI**: Tailwind-based component library for pre-styled components.
- **Toastify**: For displaying toast notifications for success and error messages.
- **React Icons**: For integrating customizable icons across the application.
- **AOS**: To add smooth scroll animations for an engaging user experience.
- **Swiper**: For creating responsive and interactive sliders.
- **React Stars**: For rendering star ratings dynamically.
- **Firebase**: Backend service for user authentication and profile management.
