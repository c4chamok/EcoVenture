      "ShortDescription": "Keokradong is a peak located in Bandarban, Bangladesh, with an elevation of 986 metres (3,235 ft). Some sources claim it as the highest point of Bangladesh. On the top of Keokradong there is a small shelter and a signboard put up by Bangladesh Army proclaiming the elevation to be 967 metres (3,173 ft). Height measured by handheld GPS shows it is 986 metres (3,235 ft) with 3m accuracy. There is a controversy about the highest point of Bangladesh, and some sources indicate Saka Haphong as the most elevated peak of the country. However, Tazing Dong is officially recognized as the highest point of Bangladesh. Keokradong is a popular tourist attraction in Bangladesh for mountaineers. Keokradong is one of the cloudiest places in Bangladesh.",
